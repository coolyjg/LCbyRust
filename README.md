# LCbyRust
Try to do some algorithm related problems by Rust. All of the problems are from LeetCode.
During this procedure, it is really obvious that fixing algorithm problems by Rust is sort of problem-related difficult. 
Problems coding with Rust may be as follows, which are concluded by me when fixing problems:
- Pointers in Rust are diverse. This causes a significantly problematic, sometimes annoying procedure when solving tree-related problems, since left children and right children are generally defined as `Option<Rc<RefCell<TreeNode>>>`, along with the ownership mechanism, which makes a kindergarten learner like me suffer. 
- Strong type system brings easier safety guarantee, but complex conversion. For example, you can not index an element from an array using i32 instead of usize. However, usize underflow is computable with no fault thrown, which may cause an infinite loop when doing binary search. 
- Pointers can not move one step by another. This means the loss of flexibilty when coding by C, but brings safety - dangling pointers will ruin the world. Anyway, safety is the biggest thing in Rust, as well as an appealing characteristic to Rusters (Oh god, I forget the precise word for Rust coders, this should be urgently corrected when I meet the word again)
